If a Windows 10 user is having any kind of trouble downloading, installing or updating applications from the Windows Store, resetting the Windows Store cache is a pretty sensible course of action, and this also holds true in the case of this problem. To reset your computer’s Windows Store cache, you need to:

Press the Windows Logo key + R to open a Run
Type wsreset.exe into the Run dialog and press Enter.
Wait for the command to be executed and the Windows Store cache to be reset.
Restart your computer, and when it boots up, check to see whether or not the problem has been resolved.
